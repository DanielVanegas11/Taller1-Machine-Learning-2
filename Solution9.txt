UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is based on the mathematical principles of Riemannian geometry, algebraic topology, and graph theory. It uses a graph-based approach to construct a high-dimensional topological representation of the data, which is then optimized using a low-dimensional embedding.

UMAP is useful for visualizing and exploring high-dimensional data, such as gene expression data, image data, or natural language processing data. It can be used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data exploration.
